# CryoFSL: an annotation-efficient, few-shot learning framework for robust protein particle picking in cryo-EM micrographs

CryoFSL is a **few-shot learning framework** designed for **automated protein particle picking in Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) micrographs**.  
Unlike traditional approaches that require large-scale training, CryoFSL achieves high accuracy with as few as **5 labeled micrographs per protein** by leveraging **SAM2 (Segment Anything Model v2) with adapter-based fine-tuning**.

CryoFSL is specifically designed for the practical settings where current particle picking methods struggle:
1. **Novel or low-resource projects** where only a handful of annotated micrographs are available (e.g., early screening of a new target or small labs without extensive annotation resources)
2. **Low signal-to-noise and heterogeneous datasets** where particle contrast varies strongly across micrographs and templates or fully supervised models fail to generalize.
3. **Workflows that prioritize particle quality over quantity**, such as downstream projects requiring high-quality reconstruction from fewer and cleaner particles.
4. **Computationally constrained environments** where full model re-training is impractical.

It is used in predicting the protein particles coordinates from the cryo-EM micrographs and generates output in the form of .STAR file which can be used in popular tools like RELION and CryoSPARC for generating 3D density maps.

## Overview
CryoFSL combines **foundation models** with **few-shot adaptation** for efficient protein particle picking. Figure below demonstrates the particle picking overflow for CryoFSL.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/biplabpoudel25/CryoFSL.git
cd CryoFSL
```

### 2. Create conda environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cryofsl
```

### 3. Data
You can download datasets from EMPIAR, CryoPPP or use your own dataset and organize them as following:

```bash
CryoFSL/
└── data/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── images/
    │   │   ├── 061.png
    │   │   ├── 062.png
    │   │   └── 063.png
    │   └── labels/
    │       ├── 061.png
    │       ├── 062.png
    │       └── 063.png
    │
    ├── valid/
    │   ├── images/
    │   │   ├── 101.png
    │   │   ├── 102.png
    │   │   └── 103.png
    │   └── labels/
    │       ├── 101.png
    │       ├── 102.png
    │       └── 103.png
    │
    └── test/
        ├── images/
        │   ├── 201.png
        │   ├── 202.png
        │   └── 203.png
        └── labels/
            ├── 201.png
            ├── 202.png
            └── 203.png
```

Micrograph name in **images** and **labels** should be same. Images in each folder contains the micrographs in .png/.jpg/.jpeg format, and the labels contains their corresponding mask with the same filename. Please make sure that the filename of the micrographs in **images** and **labels** folders are consistent.

### 4. Train
To update the path of the training and validation images and labels, go to `configs/cod-sam-vit-l.yaml` and change them. Then, you can use default training (use YAML config):
```bash
python train.py --config configs/cod-sam-vit-l.yaml
```

If you want to update the path to the images and labels, you can pass them as an argument and train with override (e.g., dataset + epochs)
```bash
python train.py \
  --config configs/cod-sam-vit-l.yaml \
  --train_images /path/to/train/images \
  --train_labels /path/to/train/labels \
  --val_images /path/to/val/images \
  --val_labels /path/to/val/labels \
  --epochs 1000 \
  --sam_ckpt /path/to/sam_checkpoint.pt
```

Training will save the trained model and training log in `checkpoints` directory. 

### 5. Testing
Evaluate the trained model on the remaining micrographs: 
```bash
python test.py \
  --config configs/cod-sam-vit-l.yaml \
  --model /path/to/trained/model \
  --output_dir /path/to/save/output/result \
  --test_images /path/to/test/images \
  --test_labels /path/to/test/labels
```

The test code will produce the following results in **outputs** folder: 
1. **micrographs_outputs** : Visual micrographs with selected particles circled in red.
2. **STAR file**: STAR file containing micrograph names and their coordinates. 
3. **all_metrics.txt**: Text document containing metrics like Precision, Recall, F1 and IoU for each test micrographs. 

After getting the star file you may use this file in **CryoSPARC** for further processing.
